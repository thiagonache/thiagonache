## About Me

My name is Thiago Carvalho, and I am a highly skilled software engineer with over 15 years of experience in IT. I am passionate about helping clients overcome complex challenges and finding innovative solutions to problems that others may have struggled with. My ability to solve challenging problems has earned me a reputation for being a reliable and effective problem-solver.

My background is in web applications, infrastructure, and backend development. I have experience in designing and implementing scalable solutions in both GCP and AWS. I understand cloud-based technologies and how they can be leveraged to build cost-effective applications. I specialize in Go development, a powerful programming language for building high-performance backend systems.

I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from small web applications to large-scale enterprise systems. I am experienced in agile methodologies and have a track record of delivering software solutions that meet the needs of users and stakeholders. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, and am excited about the possibility of contributing to the success of a dynamic company.
