## About Me

As a software engineer with over 15 years of experience in IT and a proven track record as a tech reviewer for O'Reilly, I am passionate about helping clients overcome complex challenges and finding innovative solutions to problems that others may have struggled with.

My background is in web applications, infrastructure, and backend development, and I have extensive experience designing and implementing scalable solutions in both GCP and AWS. With a deep understanding of cloud-based technologies and how they can be leveraged to build cost-effective applications, I specialize in Go development, a powerful programming language for building high-performance backend systems.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from small web applications to large-scale enterprise systems. I am experienced in agile methodologies and have a proven track record of delivering software solutions that meet the needs of users and stakeholders. As a lifelong learner, I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills and make meaningful contributions to the success of dynamic companies.
