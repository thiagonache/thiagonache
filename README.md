## About Me

Hello! My name is Thiago Carvalho.

As a software engineer with a strong background in web applications, infrastructure, and backend development, I have gained extensive experience in designing and implementing scalable and reliable solutions. With expertise in both Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), I have a deep understanding of cloud-based technologies and how they can be leveraged to build efficient and cost-effective applications.

My passion for software engineering led me to specialize in Go development, a programming language that I find particularly powerful and efficient for building high-performance backend systems. With my extensive experience in web application development and infrastructure, I have a deep understanding of the full stack and can design and implement systems that are both scalable and performant.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from small web applications to large-scale enterprise systems. I am experienced in agile methodologies, and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software solutions that meet the needs of both users and stakeholders.

As a dedicated software engineer, I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I am excited about the possibility of working with a team of talented engineers and contributing to the success of a dynamic and innovative company.
